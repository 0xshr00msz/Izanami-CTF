# Izanami: The Endless Loop

A web-based CTF game inspired by Itachi's Sharingan Izanami from Naruto Shippuden. This game is designed as an Offensive Hacking CTF with a focus on Web vulnerabilities, featuring puzzle, strategy, logic, and abstract challenges.

## Game Concept

Similar to how Izanami traps opponents in a loop of reality they must acknowledge to escape, this CTF will trap players in a series of web-based challenges that require breaking out of predetermined patterns through offensive web hacking techniques.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS + JavaScript with Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)

## Challenge Categories

The game includes a wide range of web security challenges:

1. SQL Injection
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
4. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
5. Command Injection
6. Insecure Deserialization
7. File Upload Vulnerabilities
8. API Manipulation
9. WebSocket Vulnerabilities
10. Client-Side Storage Exploitation
11. Race Conditions
12. GraphQL Vulnerabilities
13. Web Cache Poisoning
14. HTTP Request Smuggling
15. Prototype Pollution

## Game Mechanics

- **Sharingan Points**: Earned by solving challenges
- **Chakra Meter**: Limited attempts for certain challenges
- **Scrolls**: Hidden documentation/hints found throughout the game
- **Genjutsu Counter**: Shows how many "loops" the player has been through

## Difficulty Levels

1. **Academy**: Basic web vulnerabilities
2. **Chunin**: More complex exploits
3. **J≈çnin**: Chained vulnerabilities
4. **Uchiha**: Advanced techniques combining multiple attack vectors
